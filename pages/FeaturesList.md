### Document scanning
We provide automatic algorithms that detect documents and parse their data.

---

- #### Document and client provided data comparison
We compare document read data with your provided data to ensure 
client authenticity.

- #### Document blur check
To ensure best OCR results we calculate overall document
blurriness.

- #### Document detection
Our algorithms automatically detect documents in provided photos.

- #### Document expiry validation
In document analysis process we check whether document is expired.

- #### Document face biometric data points
Our document face detection and recognition A.I. models place 160
biometric points on found document face for accurate face comparison.

- #### Document face blur detection
To ensure accurate face recognition we calculate overall 
found face blurriness.

- #### Document face detection
Our algorithms automatically detect documents' faces.

- #### Document face glare detection
To ensure accurate face recognition we calculate overall 
found face glare.

- #### MRZ check-digits validation
To ensure accurate MRZ reading we validate MRZ check-digits.

- #### MRZ reading
Our algorithms automatically can detect and read MRZs.

- #### Document template name and surname reading
Our algorithms automatically can detect and read name and surname from
a document's front side.

- #### Document template dates reading and validation
Our algorithms automatically can detect and read dates 
(such as *date of birth*, *expiry date*, *date of issue*) from
a document's front side. Additionally, dates are validated to ensure valid
format and logic.

- #### Document template nationality/issuing country reading and validation
Our algorithms automatically can detect and read nationality and 
issuing country from a document's front side. Additionally, 
nationality and issuing country are validated to ensure valid format and logic.

- #### Document template other fields reading
Additionally our algorithms can automatically detect and read:
*gender*, *document number*, *personal code*, *birth place*, 
*document authority*, *address*, *driver license categories*.

- #### Supported document types
Our algorithms support these document types: 
*id card*, *residence permit*, *passport*, *driver license*, *other*.

- #### Document template and mrz data comparison
To ensure accurate OCR reading and prevent counterfeits we compare 
template data with MRZ data.

- #### Utility bill analysis
We support utility bills. However, utility bills must be reviewed manually.

- #### Manual document review
We have a dedicated manual reviewing team which ensures that automatically 
read data from documents is accurate.

---

### Face scanning
We provide automatic algorithms that detect faces and does face comparison.

---

- #### Selfie face detection
Our algorithms can automatically detect selfie faces.

- #### Blurry selfie face detection
To ensure accurate face recognition and comparison we calculate overall
blurriness. If photo is too blurry, identification is automatically denied.

- #### More than one face detection
To comply with the law and ensure that a right face was compared we calculate
how many faces are visible in the photo. If there is more that one, identification
is automatically denied.

- #### Seflie face biometric data points
Our selfie face detection and recognition A.I. models place 160
biometric points on found selfie face for accurate face comparison.

---

### Fraud prevention
The best KYC provider is the one that has the most fraud prevention techniques.
We have many algorithms and apis for fraud prevention.

---

- #### Active liveness detection
We have integrated an active filter into our web and mobile 
solutions to ensure face liveliness. 
(Active means a user is asked to take certain actions in order to successfully
determine an output.)

- #### Passive document selfie detection
Our A.I. based algorithms automatically detect whether a 
seflie from the photo is genuine or shown from the document.

- #### Passive mobile screen selfie detection
Our A.I. based algorithms automatically detect whether a 
seflie from the photo is genuine or shown from the mobile screen.

- #### Screen pixels detection
Our A.I. models can detect Moir√© patterns and prevent photos taken from screens.
