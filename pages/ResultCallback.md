# Identification result webhook callback

When a client completes identification - your registered web hook endpoint will receive a HTTP POST request containing data and status of the identification.

Your API **must** return HTTP response with status code `200`. Otherwise a client will see a failed identification message and will be redirected to a fail url.

If you are experiencing any issues receiving a callback - [Refer to a callback troubleshooting section](#callback-troubleshooting).

## Identification and callback flow

### When to expect a callback

There are certain points of time in identity verification process when your API should expect to receive a callback.

Your API should expect to receive a callback immediately when:
- A client has successfully completed an identification
- A client has consecutively failed to identify himself and has reached maximum reattempts allowed in the identification platform.  
- A client was suspected for a fraudulent activity and his session was terminated.

Your API should not expect to receive an immediate callback when (In case of these events your API will receive a callback only when a **token** (token property `tokenExpiry`) or a **token session** (token property `sessionLength`) has expired. For more on these variables refer to [Generating identification token](https://github.com/idenfy/Documentation/blob/master/pages/GeneratingIdentificationToken.md)):
- A client has consecutively failed to identify himself and has not reached maximum reattempts allowed in the identification platform.
- A client did not start an identification session.

### How many callbacks to expect

In total you should expect two consecutive callbacks per identification: 
- One generated for an automatic verification.
- Second generated for a manual verification.

Two consecutive callbacks are represented in an UML activity graph below:

## Callback troubleshooting

Not receiving a callback? These are the first steps you should take in order to resolve an issue:
- Ensure that you have provided a valid callback endpoint (it does not contain typos and is a fully specified url with http schema, port and domain name).
- Ensure that the provided endpoint can be reached from internet.
- Ensure that your SSL is set up correctly (if using https).
- Ensure that you are **actually** not getting a callback and your framework is not accidentally returning some other HTTP response e.g. 422 or 500.
